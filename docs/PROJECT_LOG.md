## 2026-10-06 — M0 — Feasibility and dependency validation

**Done**
- Inspected the machine and toolchain (`scripts/check-env.ps1`).
- Queried GitHub, crates.io, and Hugging Face APIs for versions, licenses, release assets, and model lists.
- Wrote `docs/M0_FEASIBILITY.md` (engines, models, licenses, architecture, plan).

**Worked**
- Machine: Intel Core 7 150U, 23.6 GB RAM, Windows 11 x64, no discrete GPU → CPU-only benchmarks.
- Present: Node 24.19, npm 11.17, pnpm 12.4, Rust 1.98.1 (msvc), MSVC Build Tools 14.44, Windows SDK 10.0.26100, WebView2 154, Git, Python 3.13.
- Missing: CMake, LLVM/libclang (only needed for whisper.cpp builds).
- sherpa-onnx v1.13.8: prebuilt Windows/macOS libraries and an official `sherpa-onnx` Rust crate exist. French STT/TTS model archives exist.
- whisper.cpp v1.9.4: no prebuilt Windows binaries in the latest GitHub release → source build required.

**Failed / surprises**
- Two Hugging Face model pages returned HTTP 401 (`pierre-cheneau/finetuned-kroko-fr`, `csukuangfj/sherpa-onnx-streaming-zipformer-fr-2023-04-14`) → licenses of those French streaming models are still unknown.
- Piper model cards for `fr_FR/miro/high` and `fr_FR/tjiho/model3` returned 404 → licenses unknown.
- My first environment script printed the MSVC folder name instead of its version (wrong glob depth). Fixed. See ISSUES I-001.
- The `python` on this machine is the Microsoft Store build (`WindowsApps`). Works, but note for scripts.

**Licensing findings that shape the project**
- espeak-ng (GPL-3.0) is used by sherpa-onnx's Piper/VITS/Kokoro TTS path → high commercial-distribution risk (see DECISIONS D-004).
- Piper `fr_FR-tom` is AGPLv3; `vits-mms-fra` is CC-BY-NC → both excluded.

**Open questions**
- Does a commercially usable, good-quality French male voice exist?
- Swiss-French test data source (none identified yet).
- Microphone access inside Tauri WebViews (WebView2, macOS WKWebView).
- Can sherpa-onnx offline recognition be cancelled mid-decode?

**Next**: M1 (minimal Tauri 2 app + provider contract), sherpa-onnx first. See D-002.

## 2026-10-06 — M0 — Project governance and documentation set-up

**Done**
- Added `AGENTS.md` (global rules: git approval, identity rule, documentation rules, constraints).
- Added `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/ISSUES.md`, this log, `README.md`, `.gitignore`.
- Owner decisions recorded: start with sherpa-onnx, free/open-source tools first, owner runs all commit/push/PR commands.

**Worked**: files created; no git repository exists yet (owner runs `git init`, see `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`).

**Failed / surprises**: none.

**Next**: owner reviews and commits M0; then M1.

## 2026-10-06 — M1 — Minimal Tauri 2 application and provider contract

**Done**
- Hand-written scaffold (no generator): Vite 8 + React 19 + TypeScript 7 frontend, Tauri 2.12.1 Rust backend in `src-tauri/`.
- Engine-agnostic contract: Rust traits `SpeechToTextProvider` / `TextToSpeechProvider` (TTS declared only), types in `src-tauri/src/speech/types.rs`, mirrored in `src/speech/types.ts`.
- `ProviderRegistry` + a clearly labelled **mock** STT provider (`is_mock = true`, performs no recognition) to prove the UI → Rust → provider round trip.
- Tauri commands: `list_stt_providers`, `transcribe` (runs on a blocking worker), `cancel_transcription` (cooperative `CancelToken`).
- Minimal UI: engine select, explicit language select (fr/en), WAV path input, Transcribe/Cancel, mock warning banner.
- Placeholder app icon generated with a small Python script, then `pnpm tauri icon` (Android/iOS icon folders deleted: not needed).

**Verified (this machine, Windows 11 x64)**
- `pnpm typecheck` passes; `pnpm build` (vite) succeeds.
- `cargo test` in `src-tauri`: 4 tests pass (registry lists mock flagged as mock, unknown provider error, empty path + cancellation behaviour, camelCase JSON contract). First Tauri compile took about 4 min.
- `pnpm tauri dev`: native window "SpeechLab" opens (process running, WebView2 content served), and a screenshot shows the provider list "Mock STT (no recognition) (mock)" with languages and capabilities → the `list_stt_providers` command round trip works UI → Rust → UI.

**Failed / surprises**
- `pnpm tauri dev` first failed: **port 1420 was already used** by the dev server of the separate AssistantCabinetAI desktop app (`apps/desktop`). Not touched. SpeechLab now uses port **1430** (see ISSUES I-006, DECISIONS D-008).
- One multi-file shell heredoc command failed with a bash parse error and wrote nothing; the files were re-created with the file-write tool. No impact on the repo.
- pnpm 12 automatically created `pnpm-workspace.yaml` with `minimumReleaseAgeExclude: [vite@8.3.3]` (pnpm's recent-release protection). Kept as generated; see ISSUES I-007.
- Vite 8 and TypeScript 7 are very recent major versions; they worked here without problems, but tooling/plugins may lag. Pinned via caret ranges and `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- Dev-mode file watcher printed `EBUSY` warnings for files inside `src-tauri/target` while rebuilding; harmless, the app still started.

**Not verified**
- Clicking "Transcribe" in the window (the `transcribe` command is only covered by Rust unit tests, not by a UI click).
- `pnpm tauri build` / packaging (bundling is disabled, scheduled for M7).
- macOS: not testable here.

**Next**: M2 — sherpa-onnx STT adapter (official `sherpa-onnx` crate), model download manager, French and English WAV transcription offline.
